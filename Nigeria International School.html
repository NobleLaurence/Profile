        <h2><center> My experience in Nigeria International School</center></h2>
        <p>I have been at the very esteemed Nigeria International School (N.I.S.), Embassy of Nigeria, Cotonou, 
        Republic of Benin since January, 1992. 
        In N.I.S., I have been Class Teacher (1992-1995), Assistant Head Teacher (1995-2004), 
        Head Teacher (2004-2015) and Head of Department of Arts and Social Sciences (2017, 2020 till date).
        I have a wealth of experience in School Administration having played vital roles in the 
        administration of the N.I.S. from 1995 to 2015 during which I ran the Primary School as Head Teacher and participated in the 
        meetings and activities of the School’s Board of Governors chaired by the respective Ambassadors of 
        Nigeria to the Republic of Benin for eleven consecutive years (2004-2015). I have been to the 
        International Educational Conference of the Association of International Schools in Africa in 
        Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire (1996) and the Educational Best practices Conference of the 
        Exam Ethics International in Accra, Ghana (2013) where I was decorated as an Exam Ethics Marshal 
        International. I have participated in other educational conferences, seminars and workshops 
        some of which I was the resource person.
        My hobbies are reading, writing and informed discussions on emerging societal issues.</p>
